This file is an explanation to usages of dependencies in this project.
There is some grammar errors in this file (and I am sorry about that).
Feel free to make changes to this file!

1. Color (color)
  There always been an important part of Mcnje which was cared about;
  The personalization. With the Color dependency, we can edit colors
  and blend them with other colors to make themes for main user
  experience, although, it isn't used else where. ( Sadly :'( )

2. Esprima (esprima)
  This is the (future used) dependency which is used in parsing the
  plugins. It's features are parsing and tokenizing Escript scripts,
  but only the tockenizer (gonna be) used (to parse the import tags).


3. Express (express)
  Actually I am not going to talk about this one, because you have
  probably guessed it already!

4. Font Color Contrast (font-color-contrast)
  This one is also used in theming. It helps to gather font color;
  in contrast of the background. although in version 3 of the Color,
  there is an "isWhite?" and "isGray?" feature, so we might be saying
  bye to this dependency soon...

5. INI (ini)
  used primarly in ~~/main.js where ~/options.ini loads, but there is
  a chance that it will be changed to a stable json dependency.
